Description: ALSA MIDI connection minder.
 Watches for new MIDI ports (both from hardware devices and from applications),
 and users a rules configuration file to automatically make connections.
 Will also handle reconnecting if a port is removed and later added back, like
 when a device is unplugged and then re-plugged.
